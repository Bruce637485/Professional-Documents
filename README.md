Network Topology for a a new campus project

(Description)
Scenario:	
•	Universal Remedies is expanding their operations and have built a new campus in Salt Lake City, UT
•	They have regional offices in San Antonio, TX and Vancouver, BC, Canada but the headquarters are in Chicago, IL
•	The new campus consists of an 8,000 sq. ft. office building and a 6,000 sq. ft. laboratory building (both are single story), about a quarter mile apart (there is general landscaping, sidewalks, and a parking lot separating the two buildings).
o	Office building (FloorPlan_Office.png)
  	The Regional Manager has an Administrative Assistant and 3 Secretaries
  	The 2 IT staff share an office
  	There are 7 people on the Marketing and Sales staff, split between 3 offices, the VP of Marketing gets their own office
  	The Accountant and the HR rep share an office
  	There are 4 people on the Training staff, split between 2 offices
  	There is a Doctor on staff that has her own office
  	Every office must have at least 6 network drops
  	There is a small conference room which has a large screen for presentations and a conference phone
  	There is a training classroom that should accommodate up to 30 students at a time
  	Everyone needs Internet access and access to internal resources hosted at the headquarters
o	Laboratory (FloorPlan_PharmaLab.jpg)
  	The Director of Operations has a Pharmacist and a Technician on staff and they share the Administration space
    •	This space should be connected to the network in the other building and to the Internet
  	The large Conference Room/Classroom can host up to 60 people at a time for various trainings or meetings
    •	This space needs Internet connectivity for guests but needs to be shielded from the rest of the internal network
    •	There should be 4 network drops that are connected to the internal network
  	The Operations Lab consists mostly of test equipment, manufacturing equipment, and specialized medical equipment. 
    •	This space needs to have its own network that is isolated from all other networks and that is not connected to the Internet
    •	There should be at least 30 network drops in this space 
  	The Control Room needs two network drops that are connected to the Operations Lab network and two drops that are connected to the internal network (and Internet)
  	The Analytical Lab needs 4 network drops to the Operations Lab network and 4 connected to the internal network (and Internet)
    •	There needs to be a guest network to provide access to visitors using the classroom spaces (there is a classroom space in both buildings)
    •	There are services hosted in the cloud or at the Headquarters facility which internal users need access to


Objective: 	You are to provide a viable solution for:
•	Infrastructure of the new campus (including how to connect the two buildings)
•	Connectivity back to HQ and to the Internet
•	Security
•	Backup of data
